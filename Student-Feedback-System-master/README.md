# Student-Feedback-System
 A PHP and MySQL Student / Lecturer feedback web application system.  

Task 1: Both supervisors (lecturers) and supervisees (students) must login with their correct credentials to have access to the application. On your home page you will allow the user to select their role (student or lecturer). Depending on the role the credentials will be checked against the appropriate table in the database.  [20 marks] 

Task 2: Students arrange a supervision meeting with their supervisor via email. Once the student turns up to the scheduled meeting, the supervisor logs on to the application and loads up the New Session Page. On this form there are appropriate fields for student Id, student’s and supervisor’s full name, session number, date, start time, end time, and a text box for inserting some notes about the discussion with the student including tasks to be done for next meeting. The supervisor can complete all the fields manually. However, if you program it so that the supervisor will insert just the student Id and several fields get completed automatically, you will gain an extra 15 marks as a bonus. Fields that will be retrieved from the database and inserted automatically are: student full name, supervisor’s full name, date, start time, and the session number (the last session number retrieved and incremented by one). [25 Marks]  


Task 3: When a student logs in s/he should be able to view their last supervision feedback. The logged in student must not be able to view other students’ supervisions details. On this page all the information about the session will be displayed: full name of student and supervisor, student id, date and time of the session, session number, and of course the supervisor’s comment/feedback.  [15 Marks] 

Task 4:  When a student logs in s/he should be able to view all her/his past supervisions feedback. The logged in student must not be able to view other students’ supervisions details. On this page all the information about all the sessions will be displayed:  full name of student and supervisor, student id, should appear only once. The rest, date and time of the session, session number, and the supervisor’s comment/feedback will be different for each session.  [15 Marks] 

Task 5: Produce a test plan in which a set of test cases demonstrates how successful or otherwise you have been in implementing a particular requirement. You are expected to have at least 5 records in each table of Supervisor, Supervisee, and ProjectSession. [15 Marks] 

Task 6 Complete the Self-evaluation Form below (doc version available on Blackboard under assignment). The more accurate evaluation achieves higher mark.  [5 Marks] 

Readability of code, use of descriptive, non-confusing names and inclusion of useful comments within scripts.           [5 Marks]
